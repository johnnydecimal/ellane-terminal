On Mastodon, [Ellane](https://pkm.social/@ellane) mentioned that she'd like to 'learn the command line'. What she told [Johnny](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal) was that she wants to:

> - understand what the command line IS
> - learn how not to stuff up your machine
> - learn what language it speaks
> - understand what commands DO, where things go
> - know what Homebrew is, why people use it, what it does, and how it does it.

Also she has a 'burning ambition to learn plain text accounting (hledger, specifically)'. So that's where we're headed.

And so that's what we're going to do here. From zero to hero: I'm going to teach Ellane the command line.

We'll do it all [live on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal/112522237603931013), with every post then mirrored here. This site has an RSS feed ([XML](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com/feed/feed.xml), [JSON](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com/feed/feed.json)) which your reader should detect.

So follow along however you want.

# To-do

We knocked this together pretty quickly. All feedback is welcome. Johnny will keep the to-do list here.

- Optionally dim some images (e.g. white screenshots) when in dark mode.
- ~~Make the Mastodon link on each post nicer (CSS).~~

# Later...

A list of things that Johnny would like to talk about later.

- [ttys](/learn/12-case-and-ttys/): how you can `ps ax` and the column shows which `tty` owns the process.
- [alias](/learn/16-lots-of-feedback/): creating an alias to a deeply-nested folder (or other methods of getting there quickly).
