On Mastodon, [Ellane](https://pkm.social/@ellane) mentioned that she'd like to 'learn the command line'. What she told [Johnny](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal) was that she wants to:

> - understand what the command line IS
> - learn how not to stuff up your machine
> - learn what language it speaks
> - understand what commands DO, where things go
> - what's Homebrew, and why use it and what does it do, and how does it do it

And so that's what we're going to do here. From zero to hero: I'm going to teach Ellane the command line.

We'll do it all live on Mastodon, with every post then mirrored here. This site has an RSS feed ([XML](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com/feed/feed.xml), [JSON](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com/feed/feed.json)) which your reader should detect.

So follow along however you want.
