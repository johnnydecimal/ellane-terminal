Interesting podcast excerpt, thanks. It's good to know about Macs having a different approach to case than other systems. Seems to me if we're going to err, it should be on the side of precisionâ€”so I'll play it safe by treating everything as case sensitive from now on.

Thanks for explaining the `ttys000`. I figured it wasn't something I _needed_ to know, but having that confirmed saves me from the distraction of wondering what it is every time I see it.

Just to check, I opened another window and yep, it said `ttys001`.

I played with `ls -la` for different locations on my hard drive, and the `--color=always` one, too. The latter produced mostly one colour, with splashes of another here and there. I suppose we'll get to the logic behind that later, if it's important enough to discuss.

When displaying `ls -la` there's a column on the left with information like `drwxr-xr-x@` that I don't understand.

As with the colour, we'll either get to that later or it'll turn out to be something else I don't need to worry about.

Referring to the `ls` information at [ss64.com/mac/ls.html](https://ss64.com/mac/ls.html), I tried `ls-F` as a shorter way of writing `ls -F`, but it returned an error: `zsh: command not found: ls-F`.

Okay. Commands, flags and options, arguments, in that order. Got it.
