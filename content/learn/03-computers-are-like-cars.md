Thanks, Johnny, this is outrageously exciting to my aspiring-geeky heart!

So I've done my assignment re- layers of abstraction. Makes perfect sense.

Just like my car's ignition button, I'm aware there's an organised, predictable series of events that take place once the button is pushed. Each event relies on those that came before it (pistons, oil, petrol, etc), but I don't have to think of any of that when I'm buckling up.

Computers be no different!
