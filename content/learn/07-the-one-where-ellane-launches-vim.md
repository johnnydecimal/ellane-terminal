Okay, this feels like progress!

I `cd`'d myself to the Documents folder on the first go, by typing in `cd Documents`, and used `ls` to see the list of items in that folder. Did the same with the Downloads folder, and was reminded (again) that I really need to clear that one out.

I tried a number of things to `cd` to a specific nested folder, with no luck.

One of my attempts had an alarming result:

When I could see the folder I wanted to `ls` in the `ls` of its parent folder, I typed `view [name of folder]`.

I should have known better than to experiment with unknown commands!

That gave me a blank page with a `1` at the top, and the word `Insert` at the bottom. `logout` didn't work, so I committed the press-the-red-dot-to-close-the-window sin.

No more jumping ahead of the teacher for me!
