On Mastodon, [Ellane](https://pkm.social/@ellane) mentioned that she'd like to 'learn the command line'. What she told [Johnny](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal) was that she wants to:

> - understand what the command line IS
> - learn how not to stuff up your machine
> - learn what language it speaks
> - understand what commands DO, where things go
> - know what Homebrew is, why people use it, what it does, and how it does it.

And so that's what we're going to do here. From zero to hero: I'm going to teach Ellane the command line.
